AI Usage Summary
Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5)

Purpose: To validate and explain the correctness of the Question 4 output, specifically around exception handling, interface implementation, and polymorphic behavior.

The AI was used to:
- Interpret the console output produced by the program.
- Confirm the expected behavior of the BatteryPowered and Networked interfaces.
- Clarify why heartbeat timestamps were identical.

Prompt and Excerpt
Prompt Asked:
"this is the output I got after running program for q.4. eplain me the output of each classes:"
== Exception test ==
Caught expected exception: battery 0..100

== Heartbeat timestamps BEFORE ==
DL-101 lastHeartbeat=0
TH-202 lastHeartbeat=0
CA-303 lastHeartbeat=0

== Heartbeat timestamps AFTER ==
DL-101 lastHeartbeat=1761003716
TH-202 lastHeartbeat=1761003716
CA-303 lastHeartbeat=1761003716

== Initial status via Device ==
DoorLock[id=DL-101, loc=DormA-1F, conn=down, batt=85%]
Thermostat[id=TH-202, loc=Library-2F, conn=down, tempC=21.5]
Camera[id=CA-303, loc=Quad-North, conn=down, batt=72%]

== Connect all Networked ==

== Battery report (BatteryPowered) ==
DoorLock battery = 85%
Camera battery = 72%

== Updated status via Device ==
DoorLock[id=DL-101, loc=DormA-1F, conn=up, batt=85%]
Thermostat[id=TH-202, loc=Library-2F, conn=up, tempC=21.5]
Camera[id=CA-303, loc=Quad-North, conn=up, batt=72%]

AI Response (excerpt):
"ChatGPT explained the output block by block, clarified why timestamps were identical, confirmed interface correctness, and summarized how polymorphism and exception handling worked together in the output."
Explanation of Output
The program demonstrates correct interface-based design and defensive validation. An IllegalArgumentException 
with message battery 0..100 is thrown and caught when constructing a Camera with an invalid battery percentage, proving setBatteryPercent enforces bounds
. The heartbeat values are 0 before any heartbeat calls, and identical positive timestamps after heartbeat() is invoked for each device; 
they are identical because the heartbeat time source (seconds since epoch) returned the same integer value when the calls occurred in the same second. 
Initial device status lines show the devices’ id, location, connection status (conn=down) and device-specific state (battery or temperature).
 After invoking connect() on all Networked devices, their conn fields become up, which is reflected in the updated status block. 
 Battery-only devices are reported via the BatteryPowered interface; the program iterates over devices, queries getBatteryPercent() where applicable, and prints the values.
  Overall, the output confirms the devices implement
 the required interfaces and that the program handles invalid input, heartbeat updates, network connection changes, and polymorphic reporting correctly.
